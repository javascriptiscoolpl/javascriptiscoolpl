# The domain iscool.pl or any sub-domain is not related to me. 

In the past the domain **iscool.pl** was free hosting and I had blog there at sub-domain **javascript** (javascript.iscool.pl). It was my private blog related to my JavaScript language coding. But this domain **iscool.pl** is no longer hosting service, so I had been kicked out. 

**My accounts related to the past JavaScript activity are only:**

* [npmjs.com/~javascript.iscool.pl](https://www.npmjs.com/~javascript.iscool.pl)
* [codewars.com/users/darekl](https://www.codewars.com/users/darekl)

# My current activity:

My current activity has been moved to [github.com/dprojects](https://github.com/dprojects) and this is mostly related to [FreeCAD Woodworking](https://github.com/dprojects/Woodworking).
