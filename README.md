### javascript.iscool.pl

In the past the domain **iscool.pl** was free hosting and I had blog there at sub-domain **javascript**, my private one related to my JavaScript language learning. But this domain **iscool.pl** is no longer hosting service, so I had been kicked out. 

The domain **iscool.pl** or any sub-domain is not related to me. 

**My accounts related to the past JavaScript activity are only:**

* [npmjs.com/~javascript.iscool.pl](https://www.npmjs.com/~javascript.iscool.pl)
